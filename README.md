# Oxford-IIIT-Pet_CNN
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the breed of cats and dogs in the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. The training accuracy was 0.9480, the validation accuracy was much lower. Potential improvements include adding more regularization to the architecture to overcome overfitting..
